//! DeepSeek Harness (dsh) backend module.

//! Shape-wise this is closest to hermes: a single-file runtime config tool whose
//! provider fact source lives on disk. dsh keeps its providers in a namespaced
//! `settings.yaml` (`llm-pi-ai.providers.<route>`), the default model in the
//! `agent-default-model` section, and API keys in a separate `.credentials.yaml`
//! (`REF: secret`). SQLite only stores the custom config directory and prompt
//! presets; it never holds provider records.
